    Every color's placed here: it's super convenient to have all together, it helps us identity repeated ones, for 
    instance. We try to keep them order alphabetically, although it's not a must: simply helps some of us to quickly 
    locate them.

    Conventions:
    - Key: {Identifier}Color
    - Value: lowercase hex format (you can opt for uppercase, but choosing one will keep consistency)
